## Message Changes

### Social Equality

Media Message: Chile's meme

Change: Instead of using satire that makes light of human tragedy, the message could focus on expressing solidarity with the victims and their families. It could highlight the importance of international cooperation in mine safety and rescue operations, drawing parallels to Chile's own mining experiences.

### Environment

Media Message: Myanmar news banner

Change: The message could include information about the potential environmental impacts of the incident, such as: "Rescue successful. Environmental assessment underway to ensure long-term safety of the region and its residents. Border crossings and supplies remain unaffected."

### Political Issues

Media Message: Chinese newspaper write-up

Change: While maintaining a positive tone about the rescue, the message could acknowledge the international nature of the effort: "In a display of global cooperation, Chinese rescue workers, aided by international expertise, successfully saved seven trapped international delegates. This incident highlights the importance of collaborative efforts in addressing global challenges."

These changes would better align the messages with principles of global citizenship by promoting social equality, environmental awareness, and positive international relations.
